# Lead the Deal

> Lead the deal is a Business to Business App which helps serve as a marketplace for contact information. A user starts off with 10 points, which he can use to purchase more confact information from the App. After this, this user would need to upload their own contacts in order to access any further contacts from the Lead the Deal App.

We hope to help companies or individuals leverage their existing sales contacts in order to access contact information other individuals or companies have entered into the site.
